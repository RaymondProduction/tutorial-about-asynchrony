# It is not step by step.

My little tutorial about **promis**,**generator**, **async** and **await**.
All these entities are needed for asynchronous code.


**Asynchronous code** is not step by step. This code has functions which can run independently
of other functions. And the result of the function does not come immediately after the call, but sometime later.
